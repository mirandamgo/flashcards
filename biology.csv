Deforestation and the burning of wood and fossil fuels are adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than the oceans can absorb."
"Greenhouse effect","Trapping of heat near Earth's surface by the action of atmospheric gases. The gases absorb infrared wavelengths (heat) from the sun-warmed surface, and then radiate some wavelengths downward.  a) wavelengths in rays from the sun penetrate the lower atmosphere, and they warm the Earths surface.  b) The surface radiates heat (infrared wavelengths) to the atmosphere. Some heat escapes into space. But greenhouse gases and water vapor absorb some infrared energy and radiate a portion of it back toward Earth.  C)Increased concentrations of greenhouse gases trap more heat near Earth's surface. Sea surface temperatures rise, so more water evaporates into the atmosphere. Earth's surface temperature rises."

Some boil bacteria degrade N2 and assimilate the two nitrogen atoms into ammonia. Other reactions convert ammonia to ammonium and nitrate, which plats are able to take up. Some nitrogen is lost to the atmosphere by the action of denitrifying bacteria."
"Ammonification","Part of the nitrogen cycle; soil fungi and bacteria decompose nitrogen-containing compounds, the result being ammonia and ammonium ions that plant roots can absorb."
"Nitrification","One stage of the nitrogen cycle. Soil bacteria break down ammonia or ammonium to nitrite, then other bacteria break down nitrite to nitrate, which plants can absorb."

"Eutrophication","Nutrient enrichment of a body of water that promotes population growth of phytoplankton and opacity."
"Structure of Ecosystems","If organism B eats organisms A, energy is transferred from A to B. All organisms at a given trophic level are the same number of transfer steps away from the energy input into an ecosystem.  At each trophic level, organisms interact with the same sets of predators, prey, or both. Omnivores feed at several levels, so we would partition them among different levels or assign them to a level of their own."

"Fungicides","Work against harmful fungi, including a mold that makes aflatoxin, one of the deadliest poisons."
"DDT","Fairly stable hydrocarbon that is nearly insoluble in water. Winds can disperse DDT in vapor form, and water can disperse fine particles of it.  Due to molecular properties, DDT is highly soluble in fats, and so it can accumulate in the tissues of organisms.  DDT and it's modified forms disrupt metabolic activities are are toxic to many aquatic and terrestrial animals.  Several decades ago, DDT started to infiltrate food webs and exert its effects on diverse organisms in ways that no one had predicted. Where people sprayed DDT to control Dutch elm disease, songbirds died. In forests where DDT was sprayed to kill budworm larvae, fish in the forest streams died. In fields sprayed to control one kind of pest, new pests moved in.  DDT was indiscriminately killing natural predators that keep pest populations in check.  DDT can show biological magnification."
"How much energy gets stored depends on:","1) how many producers there are 2) the balance between photosynthesis (energy trapped) and aerobic respiration (energy used)."
"Gross primary production","All energy initially trapped by the producers."

"Nitrification in nitrogen cycle","Bacteria convert nitrites in soil to nitrate, which also is a form that plants easily take up.  After that, the ecosystem loses nitrogen when denitrifying bacteria convert nitrite and nitrate back to gaseous nitrogen, and when nitrogen is leached from soil."
"Sunlight","Initial energy source for almost all ecosystems. Primary producers capture energy from the sun. They also assimilate nutrients that they, and all consumers, require."
"Classification","Organisms in an ecosystem are classified by trophic levels. Those at the same level are the same number of steps away from the energy input into the ecosystem."
"Greenhouse gases","Trap heat in the lower atmosphere, which helps make Earth's surface warm enough to support life.
